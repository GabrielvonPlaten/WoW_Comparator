Improved the post slug to exclude all special characters and symbols and remplace them with a hyphen.
Created endpoints to track the total amount of visitors per day and total queries made in the comparator.

An item will be set to the user's localStorage with a UNIX timestamp of the day of the visit as a value. If the value of the next visist is higher than 24 hours (24*3600), then it will send another POST request to the back end to increment the total amount of visists and replace the localStorage item with a new date value.

Minor styling improvements.
