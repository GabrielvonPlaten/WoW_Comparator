Created a new view for the admin and added Editor.JS as a WYSIWYG editor for the posts.

Editor.JS is a block-style editor such as the editor of Notion. How I discovered it was through this video of a channel that I'm follow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVLURx2nFqw

I followed the video and read through the docs as I implemented it to the project. After a few minutes I managed to console.log out the results.
I quickly built a simple back end and made a Mongoose Schema to try implement the data into my back end with success.
