Today I have decided to continue working on this project using the Vue CLI 3 instead of Nuxt for mainly two reasons:

## 1. Guarded Routes
Vue provides an easy way to protect routes by adding conditional statements in the router.js file. There one can specify which routes requires the user to be aunthenticated or not. Vue CLI 3 automatically generates a router.js file for one to use on the get go. No configuration needed.
Nuxt, however, does not generate a router.js file. The way one can create a new route is by creating a folder with a proper name and adding an index.vue file within it. Nuxt will configure the route behind the scenes.
One can still add a router.js and configure it like one would with VC3, but adding protected routes is a bit messy, and at times it outrights doesn't work for unknown reasons.

VC3 generates a main.js file as the root for the entire application. This file also work as a middleware. With this advantage, one can authenticate the user before the page loads.
However, in Nuxt, there's no main.js file. However, it provides to add middleware to the application by creating .js files inside a folder namned "middleware". This works as a way to protect routes when navigating through the website, but when the url is changed to change the view, the middlewares to protect such routes doesn't work.

## 2. Server Side Rendering
I underestimated the amount of effort and time I would need to make this work when the application is ready. Right after I left my internship I began to investigate how I can deploy my Nuxt app with SSR and a Node back-end.
Two days ago I began to investigate how to add SSR to a VC3. After reading a few articles and watching a few guides on how to do it, I decided to switch back to VC3.
