I began working on rendering the Mythic+ information for both player. I managed to display only the most basic of information: Dungeon name, M+ level, affixes, duration, date, and basic members information such like name and item level. I tried rendering the icons for the affixes through another GET request to another Blizzard endpoint but I could not return the results and display them properly on the page. This was also the case when I tried rendering more detailed information about the members.

Need to work on that in the future.
