Yesterday I talked to one of my closest friend who also plays World of Warcraft the work I had so far. The main critisism I received from him was the design of the Progression view of the comparator, where two players can compare their raiding progress.

After a short discussion, I agreed with his view and planned to start designing a new look for the view.
After a few hours going through some rough ideas, I came up with a more compact and simpler design. 
After adding the new design, I added the functionality to show it as a grid view for both players.
