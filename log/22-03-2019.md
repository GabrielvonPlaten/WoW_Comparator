## Blizzard's Authorization Code Flow
During my time researching how I would deploy my Nuxt application with SSR and how I can protect its routes, I have also been investigating how Blizzard's Auth Code Flow works on Postman.

The official guide: https://develop.battle.net/documentation/guides/using-oauth 

### The Reason
I want to implement the ability for the player to create an account and then use its Battle.net account to fetch its World of Warcraft characters.

### Problems
The documentation is a bit messy and unclear about how things should be done. Fortunately, Blizzard aknowledge this issue and updated the docs: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/bnet/topic/20771206933

However, following carefully the instructions again and trying to get a response on Postman, I began to receive a code 500 from the European servers. The U.S servers works(?) as intended. I receive a status code of 200 but the response is an HTML file warning me about my client not having JavaScript enabled. I'm confident I'm doing something wrong on the request.
Luckily, this feature is not top priority. For now.

## Looking Into Adding More APIs
A few months back, Blizzard has added a few more API endpoints that will display a few realm data like Mythic Dungeon Leaderboard.
I will look into how I can use these new APIs and design a new view for the website.
Here are the endpoints in question: https://develop.battle.net/documentation/api-reference/world-of-warcraft-game-data-api

I'm also working on improving the design of the landing page and the comparator page. Just minor changes.
While doing this, I had an idea of changing the background images of a few places depending of the current events going on in the game. Just to add a little more of life to the website.
This will be done using the NPM package Multer to upload and delete files.
