Today I have been going through my timeline and what I have been planning to do. I've moved a few things for later and added more things to do.

1. I was debating if I should add the PvP stats with the base character stats' view, just to these two things focused in the same place. In the end, I have decided that character stats and PvP stats should be on the same view. I will have to design new icons PvP stat icons.

2. I'm not satisfied with the Gear view. Although the shows most of the useful information a player would wanna know, the design per se of the view is boring. Currently, each piece of equipment is stacked on top of each other, and each item is a large horizontal rectangle with the equipment name and level. I will have to redesign the view.

3. One of the features registered users could have was to search for characters and guilds and mark them as favorite within their accounts. I will expand upon that idea and have the comparator view show a button to the registered users if they want to bookmark the character that they have searched.

4. The Progress view needs an overhaul in its design. I will also add Mythic+ Dungeon Runs.

5. The Vuex store is getting big. I have planned to split the State, Actions, and Mutations. I will have to put this on top.
On top of it. I will centrelize all the API calls made on the client side into their own folder.
